Zappy is a 42's School project who aim to create a multiplayer video game.
AIs play with each others, and the rendering is external.

The game consists of various components:
• A server with the current map, resources, it will take care of all the timing in the
game and is also the judge of the game (it will enforce the rules)
• One or more clients have the ability to connect to the server, with each client
assuming the role of a player. The players are then assigned to teams.
• A graphic client that will connect to the server to show what is currently happening
and let us be amazed by your work.
